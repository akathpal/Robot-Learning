# DotsAndBoxes-RL
Implemented the game using Reinforcement Learning

There are two notebook files:

## Dots-Boxes-QTable - 
It has the code which involves training using QTable.Just change the grid size in main to (3,3) to run it for 3x3 board.

## Dots-Boxes-NN - 
It has the code after replacing Q table with a neural network. Pytorch is used for this implementation.
